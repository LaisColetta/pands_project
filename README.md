# Pandas Project  
**Author:** Lais Coletta  

## Overview

This project explores the **Iris flower dataset**, a well-known dataset introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: **Iris setosa**, **Iris virginica**, and **Iris versicolor**. For each flower, four features were measured: the length and width of the sepal and petal (in centimeters). Fisher used this dataset to develop a linear discriminant model for distinguishing between the species based on these features.

The Iris dataset is widely used in Data Science and Machine Learning, often as an introductory dataset for classification problems. It consists of 150 records and five attributes: **Sepal length**, **Sepal width**, **Petal length**, **Petal width**, and **Species**.

## Project Development

The project was built based on Google research and knowledge gained in the course, particularly during Week 08 when we focused on plotting techniques. All references used in this project are included as comments in the `analysis.py` file and/or directly referenced within the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb`. Any sections of the project copied from external sources are marked in *italic* with corresponding references.

### Tools and Resources Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the analysis.

### Key Insights
The Iris dataset's popularity in machine learning arises from its small size, ease of use, and its suitability for testing classification and pattern recognition methods. One of the key reasons it's so well-suited for classification tasks is that one of the species (Iris setosa) is linearly separable from the other two species in the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project focused on the statistical analysis of the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset widely used in data science and machine learning. The analysis began by examining the datasetâ€™s structure, exploring correlations between features, and visualizing distributions to gain meaningful insights. The popularity of the Iris dataset in machine learning is attributed to its small size, efficiency in processing, and suitability for classification tasks. Notably, one of the species, *Iris setosa*, is linearly separable from the other two, making it an excellent candidate for evaluating classification algorithms.

A variety of visualization techniques were applied using Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to effectively present the data and highlight key relationships. The analysis was carefully structured to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness. While additional methodologies were considered, the final selection of techniques was based on relevance and impact, as reflected in the section labeled *Other Iris Dataset Analysis* in the Jupyter notebook.

This project serves as a foundational exploration of statistical analysis and visualization techniques, reinforcing best practices in data exploration and presentation.
