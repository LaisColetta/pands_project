## Iris flower data set

According to Wikipedia, the Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is data set created by the british statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. <i> It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).  Four features were measured from each sample, they are the length and the width of sepal and petal, in centimeters. Based on the combination of the four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other </i> [1].

This data set is publicly available to use and is commonly used by beginners in the area of Data Science and Machine Learning. It consists of a set of 150 records under 5 attributes — Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width and Species.

## pandas_project

This project was developed based on google research and the knowledge gained in this course, mainly in the class on the week 08 when we learned about more about plots. All the references used in this project are inserted as comments in the file analysis.py and/or mentioned in the text in the jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb. To prepare for this project, I worked through the Python documentation manuals of the Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn modules and I have also watched a few tutorials on youtube that are listed bellow:

1) pandas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg&ab_channel=KeithGalli
2) jupter notebook - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk&ab_channel=CoreySchafer
3) youtube video - Python Data Analysis with Iris Dataset | Data Science, plotting & graphing

On the 26th of March, I started the project by exploring some statistical analysis that could be done through tables and looking at the type of data I was working with. There are a lot of projects that use the Iris data set in Machine Learning and most of the analysis I found were being used in that context. 

I later found out that the reason why this Iris dataset became a test case for classification methods in the machine learning and the pattern recognition field is because one class of the three Iris species in the data set is linearly separable from the other two classes while the other two classes are not linearly separable from each other.

After I considered my analysis finished and I was satisfied with the variaty of plots I used in the project, I started looking at other analysis and what I could and what I would prefer to not add into my analysis. This was labed as the 'Other Iris Dataset Analysis'.

Summary and conclusions

Much of modern statistical and machine learning is based upon the work of R.A Fisher in the 20th century and he is often referred to as the father of modern statistics. Fisher developed the linear discriminant model based on the combination of the four measurement features in the Iris dataset. The dataset became a test case for classification methods in the machine learning and the pattern recognition field because one class of the three Iris species in the data set is linearly separable from the other two classes while the other two classes are not linearly separable from each other.
