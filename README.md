1) The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample, they are the length and the width of sepal and petal, in centimeters. Based on the combination of the four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Project plan:
30/03 - Start understanding what Fisher's data set is about and import files
31/03 - What programs and sources do I need to execute it (pandas?)
01/04 - Work on read me - references and documentation process
05/04 - Work on the other subject
06/04 - Commit first file (analysis)
