## Iris flower data set

According to Wikipedia, the Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is data set created by the british statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. <i> It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).  Four features were measured from each sample, they are the length and the width of sepal and petal, in centimeters. Based on the combination of the four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other </i> [1].

This data set is publicly available to use and is commonly used by beginners in the area of Data Science and Machine Learning. It consists of a set of 150 records under 5 attributes — Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width and Class-Labels(Species).

## pandas_project

This project was developed based on google research and the knowledge gained in this course, mainly in the class in week 08 when we learned about building plots. All the references used in this project are inserted as comments in the file analysis.py and mentioned in the text in the jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb. To prepare to this project, I have also watched a few tutorials on youtube that are listed bellow:

1) pandas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg&ab_channel=KeithGalli
2) jupter notebook - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk&ab_channel=CoreySchafer
3) youtube video - Python Data Analysis with Iris Dataset | Data Science, plotting & graphing


### Project plan:
I have started researching for this project on march 26th and decided to create a jupyter notebook to describe each step while analysing the data. There are many sources on the internet that discuss about iris dataset, but most of them are focused on machine learning. It has been a very interesting journey learning data analysis using python and understanding the modules that have to be imported to improve the graphs readability.
